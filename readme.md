Reducing Training Data

Major project for ARU focusing on machine learning classification. 

Question
> Machine Learning Classification: How much data is enough data?

Problem
> Machine learning has become relevant in fields as diverse search engines, speech recognition,
fraud detection, and many more.
> Though it has become popular for a variety of applications in science and technology, still the
deep learning architecture remains more of a black box.
> There is ambiguity about the degree of complexity needed and what dataset size has to do with
the outcomes.

Scope
> Investigate the optimum complexity of a deep learning architecture for solving an advanced
classification problem with an image dataset.
> Investigate the necessary dataset size - with the optimised architecture - to solve the given
classification problem â€“ i.e. achieve 90% accuracy.

Objectives
> Study and investigate existing theories and models.
> Develop a deep learning model architecture.
> Evaluate this model with a dataset.
> Perform a series of tests.
> Critically analyse the results.
> Propose a possible solution to the given problem.

Deliverables
> Literature review
> Deep learning model
> Model evaluation
> Simulation and series of tests
> Analysis of results
> Solution proposal
