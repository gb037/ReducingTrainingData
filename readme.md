# Reducing Training Data

Major project for ARU focusing on machine learning classification. 

## Question
Machine Learning Classification: How much data is enough data?

## Problem
Machine learning has become relevant in fields as diverse search engines, speech recognition,
fraud detection, and many more.

Though it has become popular for a variety of applications in science and technology, still the
deep learning architecture remains more of a black box.

There is ambiguity about the degree of complexity needed and what dataset size has to do with
the outcomes.

## Scope

* Investigate the optimum complexity of a deep learning architecture for solving an advanced
classification problem with an image dataset.
* Investigate the necessary dataset size - with the optimised architecture - to solve the given
classification problem â€“ i.e. achieve 90% accuracy.

## Objectives
1. Study and investigate existing theories and models.
2. Develop a deep learning model architecture.
3. Evaluate this model with a dataset.
4. Perform a series of tests.
5. Critically analyse the results.
6. Propose a possible solution to the given problem.

## Deliverables
1. Literature review
2. Deep learning model
3. Model evaluation
4. Simulation and series of tests
5. Analysis of results
6. Solution proposal
